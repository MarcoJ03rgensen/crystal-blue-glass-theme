# Beluga New Tab (extension)

This folder is a separate **MV3 extension** that replaces Chrome's New Tab page with an animated beluga whale swimming back-and-forth across the lighter “surface band”.

## Install

1. Chrome → `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `beluga-newtab/` folder

## Notes

- This is separate from the Chrome *theme* in the repo root. Themes are static images; animation must be done via a New Tab override extension.
