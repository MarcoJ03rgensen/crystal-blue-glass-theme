## Beluga New Tab (animated)

This repo also includes an optional New Tab override extension at [`beluga-newtab/`](beluga-newtab/) that animates the beluga SVG swimming back-and-forth across a lighter surface band.

- Install: Chrome → `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select `beluga-newtab/`.
- You can use it alongside the Crystal Blue Glass theme (themes are static; animation lives in the New Tab extension).
