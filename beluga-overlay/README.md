# Beluga Overlay (extension)

This folder is a separate **MV3 extension** that injects a small beluga whale overlay that swims back-and-forth across the top of every webpage.

## Install

1. Chrome → `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `beluga-overlay/` folder

## Notes

- This does **not** put the whale inside Chrome’s actual toolbar UI (Chrome restricts that).
- It renders on webpages only (as a fixed overlay near the top).
